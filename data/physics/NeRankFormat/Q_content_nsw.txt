function determines whole theory trivial matrix interacting fields however vevs statistics matrix observables predicted theory depend test functions generally given matrix terms pure improper wave number modes free field pm infty also energy scale measurements one obtains different functional form different energy scales energy scales one measuring already encoded wave numbers associated test functions seems test functions play extra duty determine functional form vevs least matrix form linearly smearing quantum field indirectly determining renormalization scale consequence vevs wightman functions seem clearly nonlinear functionals test functions interacting qfts ive worried argument put brings question wightman axioms insistence quantum field must linear map test function space space operators although suppose effect would logarithmic measure frequencies test functions haag kastler additivity axiom also seems problematic im aware weakening particular aspect wightman haag kastler axioms able construct models axioms parallel empirically successful qft discussed literature note dropping linearity map test functions operators algebra observables affect linearity algebra theres still perfectly good probability interpretation state algebra perfectly good hilbert space relationship measurements space time somewhat modified edit ill attempt make question slightly accessible turns follows makes significantly longer wightman functions effectively different name vacuum expectation values vevs allow reconstruction wightman quantum field given vacuum state algebra one construct wightman functions wx 1x left right hat phix hat phix hat phix left right also given wightman functions one construct algebra wightman functions satisfy somewhat arcane relationships function vvx 1x almost certainly wightman function used reconstruct wightman field object hat phix operator algebra observables operator valued distribution well behaved test function fx well behaved

amplification apply field point space time given measurement fourier transform tilde fk tells us relative amplification apply field point momentum space signal analysis object called window function looked wikipedia one talk bandwidth measurement say signal transformation high pass low pass non commutativity measurement operators time like separation quantum field theory would exactly one would want mathematical formalism modeling stochastic signal processing one talks measurements space like separated admittedly tight constraint qft stochastic signal processing formalism contrast hat phix hat phi singular mathematical object difference comparable difference smooth function dirac delta function terms operators wightman functions become wf 1f left right hat phi hat phi hat phi left right linear test functions move practical formalisms interacting qft however vevs predicted bare theory infinite renormalization fixes lorentz invariant way leaves vevs function energy scale mu measurements involved experiment thus one finds wightman functions function mu well points mux 1x terms operators muf 1f perhaps worth noting dont know whether mu satisfy relationships required wightman functions could reconstruct wightman field ive never seen discussion perturbative qft conducted terms wightman functions terms positions encode energy scales observables template constructing observables fourier transforms test functions tilde ik however already determine various energy scales measurements made experiment operate potentially much detail single number mu could say energy scale measurements mu separate energy scales determined test functions seems natural say mu functional test functions case write wf 1f muf 1f non linear functional suppose expect symmetric function less trivial example suppose two ordinary quantized klein gordon fields hat phi hat xi necessarily mass spectrum could construct quantum field hat phi hat phi hat xi epsilon square fx hat phi satisfies microcausality hat phi mathcal rightarrow mathcal hat phi mapsto hat phi nonlinear map test function space algebra observables still gaussian field interacting already start significant complications one fundamental wightman axioms restriction positive spectrum terms test functions projection forward light cone components test functions components tilde fk alpha forward light cone effect measurement results however forward light cone components 2x contribute fourier space 2x convolution means negative frequency components fx contribute although means kind nonlinearity apparently satisfy positivity energy clear means system stable non axiomatic reason insist positivity energy axiom whoops brings question positivity energy one big axioms asked course im trying

421919 physics grad student got used weird concepts behind quantum mechanics used doesnt mean fully understand though mean im surprised anymore fact quantum system might superposition state particle potential well discrete spectrum energy pairs observables measured arbitrary precision etc however problem arises im talking work non physicists friends family used think quantum mechanically im saying schr dingers cat really simultaneously alive dead dont get point seems crazy thinking would easiest way introduce core principles qm edit part seems upset people dont want go details distinguishing simultaneously alive dead measure vs superposition alive dead states mainly want understand outcome measure indeterminate ask qm id like give short answer simple postulate principle accepted makes key features qm seem natural opinion weird ideas people find difficult accept due popular pseudoscience central qm quantum superposition complex amplitude phase leads interference uncertainty principle entanglement quantization physical quantities particles problem cant explain ideas related friends accept particles two states couldnt know position momentum accept electron super abstract property called complex phase lead discrete spectrum energy course could tell need accept theory whole becomes hard swallow opinion qm sometimes suffers bad reputation exactly requires put classical intuitions scrap actually think could make perfect sense even non physicist given postulates tried looking back learning qm little success since undergrad students often precisely bombarded poorly justified postulates stop questioning points dont want get started mathematical definitions nothing like quantum systems infinite dimensional hilbert space doesnt mean anything relatives includes pretty much actual postulates qm want explanation intuitive id like avoid mumbo jumbo related wave particle duality think know im one explanations regarding inacurrate actually inefficient giving good description quantum behaviour since non physicists arent familiar properties classical wave anyway mostly used talking position quantum particle ive never heard someone say spin behaves like wave like particle im looking something fundamental universal said think important include discussion relative phase two superpositioned states leads quantum interference perhaps wave like feature applies throughout qm quantum superposition quantum computing would pretty much useless even perform one billion calculations simultaneously measuring system would get single random value goal manipulate system create destructive interference unwanted results order increase probability measuring desired value requires notion quantum phase uncertainty principle might toughest challenge since get basic idea without invoking qm first even classical mechanics impossible measure something arbitrarily big precision simply instrumental limitations second makes sense get different results measure position momentum xp neq since interact system making first observation leaving different state afterward could explain fundamental implications qm wasnt sure entanglement quantization weirdness entanglement doesnt come achieve interpret still unresolved issue far know many world copenhagen interpretation etc quantization particle properties doesnt seem like intrinsic feature qm consequence boundary conditions free electron vaccum continuous energy spectrum put potential well states forbidden exactly forbidden course even bohr explained hydrogen atom semi classical model using destructive interference state electron also quantization matter photons electrons quarks etc another story think people familiar idea matter made atoms isnt far stretch include light well point two principles dont appear quite essential ones understand qm havent found satisfying answer similar posts forum instance since im interested overall description qm wavefunctions superposition dont want get motivations behind theory also id like give accurate meaningful answer one leads directly pseudoscientific interpretations qm particles waves vice versa everything forbidden mandatory consciousness affects reality kind thing edit clarify question perhaps would say concerning special relativity sr basic assumption sr everyone always sees light traveling speed matter circumstances far good imagine im train going km throw ball front km perspective ball going km standing ground ball going km respect makes perfect sense since consider velocity train good lets replace ball photon oh oh according previous assumption see photon travelling speed even though moving km add speed measurement earlier implies perceive time space differently boom get pretty much sr course one also mention maximum speed simple assumption implies core theory would equivalent qm little assumption accepted implies theory emilio pisanty saw post comment one links end mine said im interested need qm want know explain fundamental assumption necessary build theory however true questions linked ways guess edit im interested need qm pretty obvious well turn theory best describes world want explain qm basically weird main features qm lot weirdness simply describe phenomena one one doesnt reflect essence theory whole looks like patchwork theory everyone added magical part know qm postulates convention qm mathematical formalism well use hermitian matrix observables well use wavefunction complex hilbert space represent particle rather description qm happens quantum world phenomena correctly predicts matter counterintuitive classical minds edit thank contributions havent chosen answer yet im curious see someone else give try theres little point want stress many answers give good description weird concepts qm goal wrap much possible give explanation connected little assumptions possible far knzhous answer closest im looking im entirely satisfied even though theres probably answer good enough answers close wave particle duality im fan people understand electrons particles week days waves weekend however perhaps unavoidable truly include phenomena listed thought perhaps talking quantum fields rather waves matter discussion would less likely lead misinterpretation also said well qm incomprehensible lay people think thats giving easily feels little dishonest qm secret society special elite think important researchers explain goal intend achieve general public think 2nd question physicists asked often tax money pay work really think answer well couldnt understand trust satisfying qm counterintuitive well explained make sense im looking easiest way make people realize without simply saying well forget anything know also think theory would much easier accept people often exposed ideas children high school students learn world made atoms accept even though see atoms couldnt qm part common scientific culture true may sound ridiculous first hear superposition indeterminate states isnt giving saying well need degree understand going change make appreciable

516419 physics textbook states measuring time period pendulum advised measure time consecutive passage though mean position direction results better accuracy measuring time consecutive passage extreme position one method finding time period better affect accuracy final result think shouldnt make difference time taken one full oscillation independent choice start end point statement book really correct
516609 long story short brother mine made joke stupid celebrate earth making one trip around sun new years eve got curious wondering first physicists could guess revolution earth around sun takes 25xxx days ive tried luck internet didnt find anything simple enough understand ive read keplers law nice formulas get first people knew earth revolving around sun could guess much time entire revolution take asked brother told hed would simply watch stars map every night count days came back exact position first night realistic
